What is the difference between custom reel, cut tape, tube or tray?
A custom reel is a continuous length of cut tape from one reel to maintain lot and date code traceability built to the exact quantity requested on a plastic reel.  One 18-inch (45cm) flat black leader tape and one 18-inch (45cm) flat black trailer tape are connected on both sides of the cut tape via a brass shim (length 22mm) so that the sprocket holes are aligned. The final tape is then rewound onto a plastic reel in compliance with Electronics Industries Alliance (EIA) standards. This splicing operation enables direct feeding into automated board assembly equipment. 
TI will contact the customer if the custom reel order cannot be processed for technical reasons.  A service fee will be charged for each custom reel and included in the total cost.
Cut tape is a length of tape, cut from a reel. Cut tape orders may be fulfilled utilizing multiple strips of cut tape or as individual parts for your requested quantity and shipped in an ESD or MBB bag.
Tube or tray devices are often shipped inside a sample box or in the tube or tray dependent on availability
All parts are packed according to the ESD (ElectroStatic Discharge) and MSL (Moisture Sensitivity Level) protection requirements determined by TI.

A custom reel is a continuous length of cut tape from one reel to maintain lot and date code traceability built to the exact quantity requested on a plastic reel.  One 18-inch (45cm) flat black leader tape and one 18-inch (45cm) flat black trailer tape are connected on both sides of the cut tape via a brass shim (length 22mm) so that the sprocket holes are aligned. The final tape is then rewound onto a plastic reel in compliance with Electronics Industries Alliance (EIA) standards. This splicing operation enables direct feeding into automated board assembly equipment. 
TI will contact the customer if the custom reel order cannot be processed for technical reasons.  A service fee will be charged for each custom reel and included in the total cost.
Cut tape is a length of tape, cut from a reel. Cut tape orders may be fulfilled utilizing multiple strips of cut tape or as individual parts for your requested quantity and shipped in an ESD or MBB bag.
Tube or tray devices are often shipped inside a sample box or in the tube or tray dependent on availability
All parts are packed according to the ESD (ElectroStatic Discharge) and MSL (Moisture Sensitivity Level) protection requirements determined by TI.

In Australia, please provide the ABN number of your company.
In Mexico, please provide your RFC number.
In Korea, if you are purchasing on behalf of your company, please choose “business.”  If you are purchasing as an individual, please provide PCCC (Personal Customs Clearance Code) to avoid the goods being held at Customs.
